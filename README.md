This is the implementation of the Guided Scale Space Radon transform for thick linear structures detection in images based on two papers:  "Goumeidane, A.B., Ziou, D. & Nacereddine, N. Guided Scale Space Radon Transform for linear structures detection. SIViP (2024). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11760-024-03071-x" and "Djemel Ziou, Nafaa Nacereddine, Aicha Baya Goumeidane. Scale Space Radon Transform. IET Image Process (2021).  https://doi.org/10.1049/ipr2.12180"
Here, the detection is managed so that only linear structures present in the images are considred so the scale  space radon transform integration is almost blind regarding image features that do not have as orientation the integration orientation. The detection needs to set some parameters like the Scale Space Radon Transform parameter  sig and Hessian scales  and , which are all related to the structures thickness and must be chosen accordingly.
